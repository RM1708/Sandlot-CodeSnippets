On the command line, you can do this more directly with cat. Redirect its output to the file and type the input line by line on cat's standard input. Press Ctrl+D at the beginning of the line to indicate the end of the input.

$ cat >foo.txt
First line.
Second line.
Third line.
Ctrl+D

In a script you would use a here document to achieve the same effect:

cat <<EOF >foo.txt
First line.
Second line.
Third line.
EOF
